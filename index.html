<h2><a name="ESLR2" id="ESLR2"></a>School ESLRs Descriptions (Header 2)</h2>
<p>At AIS&nbsp;we define our educational program by our Expected Schoolwide Learning Results (ESLRs). This set of expectations articulates what each student should know, understand and be able to do upon leaving AIS.&nbsp;Working from our ESLRs, our educational program will equip all students with the knowledge, competencies, and orientations needed for success in a thinking, meaning-centered curriculum.ESLRs guide teachers towards implementing programs and conditions that maximize learning success for all students in a standards-based curriculum. Developed through a collaborative process involving students, families, teachers and administrators, the American International School states that every student is prepared to be:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<span class="eslrTitle">global citizen (class = eslrTitle)</span>, who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contributes to the improvement&nbsp;in the lives of others both within the school and the wider community</li>
  <li>Plays a positive role in society</li>
  <li>Shares a sense of&nbsp;collective responsibility&nbsp;for the planet and those who inhabit it</li>
</ul>
An&nbsp;<span class="eslrTitle">effective communicator (class = eslrTitle)</span>, who:
<ul>
  <li>Demonstrates proficiency in written and spoken English</li>
  <li>Selects and uses technology appropriately</li>
  <li>Expresses themselves through Visual and Performing Arts</li>
</ul>
An&nbsp;<span class="eslrTitle">empowered thinker (class = eslrTitle)</span>, who:
<ul>
  <li>Solves problems and applies learning to real-life situations&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Thinks critically and makes informed decisions</li>
  <li>Accesses and manages information effectively</li>
</ul>
A&nbsp;<span class="eslrTitle">well-rounded individual (class = eslrTitle)</span>, who:
<ul>
  <li>Assumes responsibility for the choices they make and the actions they take</li>
  <li>Works both independently and collaboratively</li>
  <li>Leads an active, balanced and healthy lifestyle&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2> <a name="Academics" id="Academics"></a>Academics (Heading 2) </h2>
<p>Our Expected Schoolwide Learning Results support and shape the academic program at AIS, ensuring we never lose focus on what an AIS education means: the growth of well-rounded individuals who have the power to think critically, communicate effectively and as genuine global citizens, understand and accept they have a duty and responsibility to make our world a better place.   In every section of our school, students are fully engaged in an appropriately robust and challenging academic program, aligned with clearly articulated US educational standards that we expect all students to meet. </p>
